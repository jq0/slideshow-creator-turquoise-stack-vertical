#### Make Your Images Stand Out
WOWSlider allows you to display your pictures in brilliant, professional exhibits and slideshows. Upload or drop images directly to the application and use a number of updating and display options to increase graphical impression.

#### Without jQuery?
If you desire not to utilize jQuery in your creation, the idea of putting a big library just that you may slide images is not a good idea. If you delete all JavaScript but ".js" calls from a page, the WOWSlider functions as a absolute CSS slider! Even though JavaScript has been deleted or is not supported, this perfect CSS fallback remains to function well.

Publishing your slideshow to Joomla or WordPress is easy. WOWSlider has the ability to export to both Joomla and Wordpress plugins.

#### Video Slides
Obviously you know that web-based video, YouTube in particular, has become even more popular compared to cable tv. YouTube and Vimeo are both supported by WOWSlider, letting you liven up your slide show presentation by complementing your regular photos.
